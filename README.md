# Fitness QnA site

This site was built for educational purposes using React/NextJS/TailwindCSS and somewhat modeled upon stack overflow.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You can run with docker in terminal:

```bash
docker compose up
```

or just run the development server in terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
